# [Cmds](https://github.com/Sondro/Cmds): 
_Useful Command-lines for Programming_

### Purpose:
```
1. Fast demoing or use for non-programmers and others short on time.

    [!] A good example would be in Java where most users don't hava Java 
    set in their path and can't run .jars by double clicking them 
    (and thus need a .bat or they have an unusable program).

2. Speed development for developers.
```
### To-Do:
```
1. Convert bat to bash (possibly using Batsh)
2. Add more MongoDB/Node cmds
3. Make reference doc
```
